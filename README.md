# CSE 535 Mobile Computing Project 1
The idea of this project is to create an Android Application that lets users click any picture and
upload the image to a server. As already mentioned, this project has two parts, a) Building the
Android Application with which the users can click the picture and select the category of the
image, and b) Creating a server that will help store the application based on the category
selected.
Project 1 will be individual. Everyone is expected to submit a video of the android application
working along with the source code. This application will be reused for Project 2 and Project 3.
Deliverables:
1) Mobile Application: Develop an android or iOS application that opens the back camera
and lets the user click an image. This application then sends the image over to the
server along with the category information to store in the server. The application should
have at least two pages. Page1 should ask the user if the user wants to click a picture or
not. The second page should ask the user to input the category of the image the user
just clicked from a dropdown item list. This page should also have an upload button that
sends the image and the information to the server.
2) Server Side: Develop your local server on your computer. It is recommended that you
use Flask to build your local server. The server needs to store the images in the
respective folders of each image category.
Submission:
1) Source Code of both Application and server.
2) Video of working demonstration of the application and the server.
3) A 1-2 pages report explaining the technical workings of your application.
All the above things need to be zipped together and uploaded on Canvas.
Important Dates for Project 1:
1) Due Date to Submit: 09/07/2022 at 11.59 pm (Arizona Time)
